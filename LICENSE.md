This license frees your work, to share and reshape with care,  
But heed these words, these guidelines to declare.  
Credit the source, the minds that came before,  
Whose works inspired, forevermore.  
No profit sought, no commercial gain,  
Let sharing thrive, let knowledge remain.

Adapt and remix, transform and build anew,  
But keep the spirit of sharing, honest and true.  
If you reshape this work, set your creation free,  
Under the same terms, for all the world to see.  
Let others explore, build and expand with delight,  
Share your creation, and shine ever so bright.
